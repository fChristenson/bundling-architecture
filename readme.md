# Splitting frontend unit tests

## What we will cover

- How frontend unit tests grow over time
- How to think about code structure to make testing easy
- What we can do when our tests are already slow

## Notes

Frontend unit testing is not a popular topic. Many struggle with how to do it well.

Over time your code will grow and your test will start to slow down.
This happens for a number of reasons:

- You have more code.
- You have added animation delays to your components.
- You have code that needs compiling.
- You have css files that are parsed in to your Javascript.

In this video I will show you how modular thinking can help with these issues.
